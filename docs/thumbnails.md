# Thumbnails

For browsing a large number of samples at scale, we generate **thumbnail images** for individual samples and use these image files to show samples on the cohort-level view.

If you loaded your sample for the first time on your browser, you have to generate thumbnails by clicking on the "Generate Missing Thumbnails" button on the left-top corner. 

These generate thumbnails will be stored on your local browser. Which means, you can safely close the browser and reopen it without losing the generated thumbnails.

?> Clicking on the "Generate Missing Thumbnails" button trigers the generattion of missing thumbnails. This takes up to 10 seconds per sample.
