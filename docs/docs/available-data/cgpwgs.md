# Cell Line Data with Read-level View
<!-- # CGPWGS & HMF Data -->

1. [Cell line whole genome data with sequencing reads](https://chromoscope.bio/app/?demoIndex=1&domain=1-248956422&external=https://somatic-browser-test.s3.amazonaws.com/configs/cell.line.benchmark.json) (2 samples)

    - The data accompanying publication by [Fang et al, Nat Biotechnol, 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34504347/) was downloaded from the SRA archive (project ID: SRP162370). The triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line (HCC1395) and a B lymphocyte-derived normal cell line (HCC1395BL) from the same donor, with SRA file IDs from project ID SRP162370. The tumor versus normal analysis was performed on sample 'SRR7890905' (tumor) versus 'SRR7890943' (normal).
    - The cell line was analyzed using both the suite of algorithm from the Sanger institute ([CGPWGS](https://github.com/cancerit/dockstore-cgpwgs)) and the Hartwig Medical Foundation ([HMF Tools](https://github.com/hartwigmedical/hmftools)).
