# Frequently Asked Questions

### Q. Which browsers are supported?

The browser is currently optimized for Google Chrome, and we do not currently support other browsers, such as Safari and Firefox at the moment. However, we plan to support other browsers as well in the future. 

### Q. What are the requirements for using AWS CLI or AWS APIs to visualize data stored on private S3 buckets?

[Two prerequisites](../loading-data/loading-private-data) must be met:

1. appropriate [AWS security credentials setup](../loading-data/loading-private-data#aws-security-credentials-setup); and
2. correct formatting of the cross-origin resource sharing [(CORS) configuration file](../loading-data/loading-private-data#cors-configuration-file). 

Refer to the documentation linked for further details.
