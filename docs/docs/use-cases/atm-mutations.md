# Cancers with Biallelic ATM Mutations

The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene is essential in the detection and signaling to repair DNA double-strand breaks.[^1] Carriers of germline mutations in ATM are predisposed to cancer[^2],[^3] and ATM is also often mutated somatically. In light of new cancer therapies targeting cells with ATM loss, we hypothesized that ATM loss would result in a mutational signature apparent in cancer genomes.

In order to evaluate the evidence, we prepared a Chromoscope configuration containing 21 cancers with pathogenic mutations in ATM, as annotated by the PCAWG consortium[^4]. In this data, cancer genomes with ATM loss display a subtle but non-characteristic pattern of chromosomal instability in this tumor group. Larger cohort sizes and stricter annotation of pathogenic mutations leading to complete ATM loss might be needed.
