# Cancers with Biallelic Loss of CDK12
- Tumors with pathogenic CDK12 mutations display chromosomal instability.
- This visualization of 12 cancers shows the genomes dominated by large (100kb) duplications, to a higher extent than the CCNE1 group. 
- This visualization also features novel and compound patterns of structural variants ([example](https://chromoscope.bio/?demoIndex=4&domain=597601479.8815027-616292105.2587856&external=https://somatic-browser-test.s3.amazonaws.com/cdk12_oncokb_sel/configs/cdk12_oncokb_sel.all.config.json)).
