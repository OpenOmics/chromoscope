# Breast Cancer Co-amplifications

- It has been known that amplifications of chromosomes 8 and 11 in breast cancer co-occur. This analysis shows that the amplifications are often connected by inter-chromosomal translations, implicating chromosome 8/11 as an early event in their formation.
- Adjacent segments of loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH) are consistent with this model of amplicon origin. The visualization highlights commonalities in features of the amplicons across 23 samples.
